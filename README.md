# LendingClub_2017Q2
Python Machine Learning Project on Lending Club Dataset for 2017-Q2. 

Below are some of the Questions that we are planning to analyze:

Lets also decide priority for below:

1) Predicting who gets approve / decline for a Loan. 
2) Predicting default loan_amnt.
3) Predict int_rate for loan.

For below 2 points, we need to do feature selection differently (different approach). This is also probably after loan approved. So, need features that are related to after loan approaved.  
4) Classify payment status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) based on other features selection.
5) predict grade of loan (grade)


Some Exploration points:
1) Feature Selection
2) Correlations between features

3) PCA
4) LDA
5)
